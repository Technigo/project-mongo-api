- A minimum of one endpoint to return a **collection** of results (array of elements)
- A minimum of one endpoint to return a **single** result (single element).
- Your API should make use of Mongoose models to model your data and use these models to fetch data from the database.
- Your API should be [RESTful](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2018/01/understanding-using-rest-api/)
