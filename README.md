# Mongo API Project

This project is about working with MongoDb and creating an API .

## The problem

To create this API I had to work with NodeJs, express, Mongoose and MongoDb. I learned how to create API endpoints, how to create models and how to fetch data from MongoDB using Mongoose. Also I used MongoDb Compass. When I got stucked with ideas or soultions I used Google and StackOverflow.

##  Endpoints:
- Root: `/`
- books (shows the books Library): `/books` 
- title: `/books?title=(book title)`
- author: `/books?author=(book author)`
- books by ID: `/books/id`
