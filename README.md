# Project Mongo API

This project is a RESTful API built with Node.js, Express, and MongoDB using Mongoose for data modeling. It allows for the creation, retrieval, and filtering of data stored in MongoDB, with routes that serve both individual documents and collections.

## The problem

The goal was to build a robust API that interacts with a MongoDB database using Mongoose models. The main challenge was seeding the database and understanding what setup and configurations that was needed to be done for a windows enviroment. I used MongoDB, Express, and Node.js to implement the API, and incorporated seeding functionality triggered by an environment variable (RESET_DATABASE=true) for populating the database.

If I had more time, I would improve query performance with advanced filtering options.
