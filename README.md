# Mongo API Project
This project's goal is to look at how to use Mongodb to store data, and how to query that data from and API. This database is built using MongoDB, modelled and manipulated using mongoose. Then the API server is built with Node on Express and the aim is for my endpoints to follow RESTful standards. Some endpoints manipulate the data returned by making use of mongoose's specific query comparison operators.
