# Mongo API Project ðŸ–¥

This project follows on from my project express-api where I used a set of data locally. This time I model my database using Mongoose models, and persist the data in a database.

## The problem. ðŸ¤“

The API I have worked with has: 

- Two different routes. 
- One endpoint to return a **collection** of results (array of elements)
- One endpoint to return a **single** result (single element).
- The API make use of Mongoose models to model the data and use these models to fetch data from the database.
- The API is [RESTful](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2018/01/understanding-using-rest-api/)
