# Project Mongo API

I started off with project by installing MangoDB and brew on my computer. 

I added my own json file to the database generated by AI. The json fills consists of different web errors messages. 

This is a simple API that provides information about errors. It allows users to retrieve error details by ID, or search for collection of errors by the length of the message property. 

The API is built using Express.js and utilizes MongoDB as the database for storing error data.

## The problem

- problem with the conflicting route patterns, which prevented the desired functionality from working as expected.
- usage of parseInt, findOne or findById.
