# Mongo API Project

 The goal was to build a RESTful API using sample data and start using a database to store and retrieve the data.

## The problem

The solution was to use mongoDB and mongoose, practicing mongoose methods and seeding the cloud database with the data. I used a sample data set of historical prices for bitcoin from 2013 to show prices and market cap in each year until 2021.
