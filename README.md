# Project Mongo API

It's time to level up your APIs and start using a database to store and retrieve data from and use that data to produce a RESTful API.

**What you need to do**
✓ Your API should have at least 2 routes. Try to push yourself to do more, though!
✓ A minimum of one endpoint to return a collection of results (array of elements).
✓ A minimum of one endpoint to return a single result (single element).
✓ Your API should make use of Mongoose models to model your data and use these models to fetch data from the database.
✓ Your API should be RESTful

## The problem

I started going through the videos for this week and then coded along to the live session recording that got me started on the project. If I had more time I would create some frontend as well.
