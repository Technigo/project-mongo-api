# Mongo API Project



## View it live



## What I got to learn ðŸ§ 

* What MongoDB is
* How to model data in Mongo using Mongoose
* How to store secret information such as database passwords
* How to return useful error messages from API endpoints

## Requirements reached ðŸ§ª

* The API have at least 2 routes - with a minimum of one to return a collection of results, and one to return a single result
* The API is deployed to Heroku 
* The API use Mongoose models to model data and use these models to fetch data from the database.
* The API is RESTful

## Strech goals reached ðŸ§˜

* Implemented filters via query parameters to filter the data being returned from endpoints which return an array of data.
* Implemented 'pages' using `[.skip()](https://mongoosejs.com/docs/api.html#query_Query-skip)` and `[.limit()](https://mongoosejs.com/docs/api.html#query_Query-limit)` to return only a selection of results from the array. 
* On routes which return a single item, there's an error handle when the item doesn't exist.
