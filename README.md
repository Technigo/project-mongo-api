# Project Mongo API

This project involves building a RESTful API using Node.js, Express, and MongoDB with Mongoose models. The goal is to persist data in the database and create endpoints to retrieve information. The provided dataset including Netflix titles is used, generate seed data and implemented a fex routes in a RESTful manner to be able to show and navigate to specific titles, titles from specific countries and so on. The endpoints are presented by MarkdownIt.

## The problem

To be able to build this project I studied how Mongo Compass and atlas worked closly, got some help from my team and Google!
