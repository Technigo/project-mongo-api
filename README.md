# Project Mongo API

This Week we got introduced to MongoDB and the word of deploying a self made API.

## The problem

I worked with the same database and endpoints as last week but this time using mongoose to work together with MongoDB instead of plain JS. It was fun to refactor the code from last week into something else.
