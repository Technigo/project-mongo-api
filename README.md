# Mongo API Project

Building an API in mongo db

## The problem

To list all books: /books

To find by query: `/books?numPages={query}` (the number you enter + everything above), `/books?averageRating={query}` (the number you enter + everything above), `/books?ratingsCount={query}`(the number you enter + everything above), `/books?languageCode={query}`

To list all authors: /books/authors (shows in unordered list)

To find by id: `/books/{id}`
