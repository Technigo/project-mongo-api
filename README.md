# Project Express API

In this week's project we got to work with modelling data using MongoDB and Mongoose. The task was to use Mongoose to create an API with different endpoints that fetched items from an Mongo database and returnes either arrays of data or single items. Our endpoint should also return useful error messages if the data couldn't be fetched or a query not returning any items. 

## The problem

I started watching and reading the material for the week as usual and then did the video code-along with Damien and practiced using Mongoose models and seeding my database. I followed along the live code sessions to work out how to setup Mongo DB Compass with Homebrew and then started working on my own mongo API. Most of the week has been spent trying to understand how the different parts of Mongo DB Compass, Atlas and my repo connects and how to deploy. With a lot of help from each other we finally figured things out.
