# Project Mongo API

The project demonstrates working with MongoDB/Mongoose, implementing RESTful principles, and building a functional API with filtering capabilities.

## The problem

I set up a MongoDB database with environment variables for secure access and added database seeding to populate MongoDB with The Sims npcs data. Had to troubleshoot MongoDB connection issues but eventually got it to work.
I created API endpoints to:
Get all NPCs with filtering options
Find specific NPCs by ID
View API documentation

I also implemented filtering by game version, life stage, and category
