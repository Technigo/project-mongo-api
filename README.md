# Mongo API Project

This weeks project was to create a REST api using express, and to store and retrieve data in mongoDB.

## The problem

I started out modeling the db-object and tried seeding the database. Then I tried out some different queries to get the feel of the syntax. I re-used my endpoints from the last api-project, but added the retreival of data from the DB.
I experimented with the $and operator a little bit apart from the regular filter queries with only one parameter. As I am used to relational databases and SQL I think it was a bit challenging but very useful.
