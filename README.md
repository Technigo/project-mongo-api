# Project Mongo API

This project implements a RESTful API using Express and MongoDB to manage and serve Netflix titles data. It includes endpoints to fetch collections of titles, individual titles, and filter titles by type (movie or TV show).

## The problem

The task involved creating a RESTful API that interacts with a MongoDB database to store and serve Netflix titles data. The approach taken was to use Express.js for handling HTTP requests, Mongoose for modeling data and interacting with the MongoDB database, and Cors for enabling cross-origin resource sharing. The project utilized a seed data function to populate the database with Netflix titles data from a JSON file. The implemented endpoints enable fetching all titles, titles of a specific type (movie or TV show), and a single title by its ID.
