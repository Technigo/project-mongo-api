# Mongo API Project

The assignment this week is to create a mongodb database that stores data, and API endpoints that can retrieve data. I struggled a bit with setting up my database locally, something was not right with my mongodb-installation. Once i got that working, it was actually surprisingly easy to deploy the database to Atlas. I think this has been a really interesting week where i have learned a lot, aand had a few aha-moments where things have fallen into place in terms of my mental model of how a database and an API interact. Unfortunately that is not really reflected in my project this week which is very basic. I hope to aim for more features in next weeks project!
