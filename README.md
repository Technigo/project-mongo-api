# Mongo API Project

A project for practicing building a database to store and retrieve data from and use to produce a RESTful API. 

## The problem

To build the database I used MongoDB and MongoDB Compass, Mongoose and Postman. During the project I learnt how to model data in Mongoose, how to fetch items from a Mongo database using Mongoose and how to seed large amounts of data to a database. The API has a few different routes which return both collections of results and single results, created with the user in mind.
