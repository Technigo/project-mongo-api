# Project Mongo API

This is a RESTful API built using Express and Mongoose to provide access to a dataset of Nintendo Switch games. The dataset includes game details like id, name, category, release_year, and rating. The project demonstrates how to model data with Mongoose, seed a MongoDB database, and build endpoints to query and retrieve data.

## The problem

The task was to create an API that fetches data from a MongoDB database using Mongoose. Key challenges included:

1. Modeling the dataset with Mongoose to ensure the data was stored consistently.
2. Seeding the database with a JSON file containing the dataset.
3. Creating RESTful endpoints for filtering and retrieving data based on parameters like category, release_year, and rating.
4. Writing clean and reusable code while adhering to RESTful principles.

To solve these challenges, I:

- Used mongoose to define models and interact with the database.
- Wrote a seeding function to populate the database.
- Used query parameters to add filtering and sorting functionality to the API endpoints.
- Tested the API with tools like Postman and debugged using console logs.

If I had more time, I would:

- Implement pagination using .skip() and .limit().
- Add more advanced querying using MongoDB's aggregate pipeline.
- Enhance error handling and validation of query parameters.
