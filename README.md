# Mongo API Project

The project was to start using a database to store and retrieve data from and use that data to produce a RESTful API.

## The problem

This project used the same data as the previous one, but seeding and fetching data from a Mongo database instead of a local file. It was interesting noticing the differences between the two methods, especially how query strings was implemented. I would like to dig deeper into how to control the data you get from the various queries, and also how to implement sortings.
