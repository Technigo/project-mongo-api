# Project Mongo API

The task was to create a RESTful API thatwould fetch data using Mongoose models.

## The problem

I found this week a little tricky - not because of the coding part, I thought that wasn't all that difficult, but I had a hard time wrapping my head around the whole Mongo thing, why it's used and how all the deploying works. I think I still don't quite understand it completely, but I managed to deploy a working site anyway.
