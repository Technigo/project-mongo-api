# Project Mongo API

This project is the first time i used MongoDB! The data is modelled with Mongoose, and seeded to a database, I used MongoDB Compass to check out the database, and MongoDB Atlas to deploy it. There is "secret" information stored in a .env file. 

## The problem

The trickiest part of this project was the deployment. There were many turns in this that I had to work through. I learned a little more about handling errors and using them to trouble shoot my code. In frontend, I always use console log to know exactly whats happening and what data is comming through to what function etc, but this was a little harder.
