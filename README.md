# Project Mongo API

The assignmentt was to use Mongo DB to create a database that allows us to store and retrieve data. That data should then be used to create a RESTful API.

## The problem

I looked at last week's project and this weeks videos and code sessions. I then adapted what I'd learned for this weeks assignment. Feedback from last weeks project proved very useful for documenting endpoints. The database deployment guide on Notion was a bit confusing and outdated, an updated version would be much appreciated.
