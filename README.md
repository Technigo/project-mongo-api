# Project Mongo API

Mongo API about Netflix movies and TV shows.

## The problem

The structure was not hard to learn. To have a better understanding, I also find some extra videos online. I didn't use aggregate this time, but want to use it for my final project's backend part. The biggest problem I met was deploying on Render. I got the error 
const err = new MongooseError(message) It took me a while to find the solution. I have tried many sulutions which I found by google. In the end I found, I didn't sent the correct information on Atlas.
