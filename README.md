# Mongo API Project

We should create endpoints for one unic search and a search result with more hits. 

## The problem

I started to create a endpoint were you can see all songs at Sporify, top 50. Then you can search for the unic ID of 1 to 50 to see one song at the time. You can also do a search on a artist so see if that artist is on the top 50 list or not.
