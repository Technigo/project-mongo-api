# Mongo API Project

This week we used Mongodb to store data and queried that data from our own RESTful API.

## How I built it

I created a simple dataset containing some of my fav books. I built several endpoints using regEx and Mongoose methods. I also practiced handling errors by setting some error messages.

## The problem

A problem I faced was an error that got solved by using try and catch.
