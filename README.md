# Mongo API Project

This is a project as part of Technigo Bootcamp. This weeks assignment was to connect a database using mongoDB to our built API.

## The problem

I had a lot of errors when trying to connect to mongodb compass and since i've never used it before it was harder to understand the error messages but finally I was able to do it. I used the books data which were provided by Technigo to build a few end points and store the data in mongoDB.

If I had more time I would create a front end which would display data requested from the API.
