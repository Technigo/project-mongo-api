# Mongo API Project

The assigment for this week was to creat an API using mongoDB, Express, Atlas and Heroku.
I decided to use the Netflix data.
## The problem

I ended up doing very few paths and instead adding search paths with .find in the main path.
The reasoning was to avoid needing to fetch for each different search parameter and hence slow down the (potential) website. The data I chose wasn't huge but still substantial with over a 1000 entries, so I thought it was good practice to take that into consideration.

Deploying to Heroku is pretty straight forward but setting up the connection to Atlas was a bit more tricky.

My main problem was that due to circumstances I didn't have time to make a frontend for this project or to dive that deep. I would have loved to make a frontend but also to have added more to the API and just to play around with it in general for the sake of learning.
I plan on doing that as soon as I have the time for it though.
