# Mongo API Project

This is the project of the 18th week of Technigo's bootcamp where the task is to use Mongo DB and Mongoose to set up a database. 

## The problem

First I made the model and then seeded the database. I made two routes, one for all the Netflix titles and one for a single title. I also made queries to be able to find shows by title, country and cast. 
The next step would be to add pagination and more queries.
