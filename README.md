# Project Mongo API

During this weeks project we were using MongoDB to store our data, and learned how to query that data from our API.
We used MongoCompass to view the data, a server.js file and mongoose to mainiplulate the data, and finally mongo Atlas and google cloud to deploy and host the backend.

## The problem

My family was sick this week so I have only followed the tutorials/lessons that we were given and I will explore more on my own when I have an oportunity.
