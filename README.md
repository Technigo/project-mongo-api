# Project Mongo API

This week project was a bit similar to last week, we were given data (or you could create your own if you want to) to create different end points using MongoDB and Mongoose.

## The problem

I would say that the problem that I face was the setting up of the different tools we need it for this project; they sound a bit alike but they perform different task (now I know that)
Another problem/situation it took me a while to plan the end points; then I plan if I were the user, What would I like to see?
I used the technoglogies learned this week, MongoDB and Mogoose.

If I have had more time, I would have create my own data with more entries.
