# Project Mongo API

The project demonstrates working with MongoDB/Mongoose, implementing RESTful principles, and building a functional API with filtering capabilities.

## The problem

Built a RESTful API using Express and MongoDB to manage characters from The Sims games. Set up MongoDB database with environment variables for secure access and added database seeding to populate MongoDB with Sims character data. Had to troubleshoot MongoDB connection issues but eventually got it to work.
I created API endpoints to:
Get all NPCs with filtering options
Find specific NPCs by ID
View API documentation

I also implemented filtering by game version, life stage, and category
