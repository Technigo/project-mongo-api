# Beer style guide API

This dataset uses parts of the Beer Judge Certification Program (BJCP) 2015 guidelines from Kaggle. The beer style guidelines are used in order to categorize beers and judge beer competitions. 

## The endpoints

/beers - all beers in a long list
/beers?style= - All beers in a certain style - example query: /beers?style=Kellerbier
/beers/:id - A certain beer - example query: /beers/6460d8450c3f651774e546c8

## The problem

This week I was sick again. I've attempted a frontend anyway. If I had more time, I would definitely work on different aggregations, filters and more paths. Would also be very nice to work on the frontend and make it user friendly.
