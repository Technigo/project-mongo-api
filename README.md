# Mongo API Project

This project aims to practise how to migrate data from json file into the MongoDB database by using mongoose package and create different API endpoints with GET methods.

## The problem

This week project went quite well. I managed to solve most of the problems. I leared how to use skip() and limit() to split data into differnt pages in the API. Moreover, what I was proud of is I practise using MongoDB aggregate function and various stages in the database pipeline.
