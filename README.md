# Project Mongo API

Replace this readme with your own information about your project.

Start by briefly describing the assignment in a sentence or two. Keep it short and to the point.

The idea with this project was to get familiar with using a database, to store and retrieve data from it. Then use the data to produce a RESTful API.

## The problem

I started out by installing and configure needed libraries, such as express-list-endpoints and dotenv. I decided to work with the provided dataset of book reviews, created a mongoose model and defined a book Schema. I went on to create routes for API documentation, displaying all books and finding books by their ID or ISBN. Lastly I decided I wanted query params for sorting books by ascending or descending order, accordning to their average rating.

As a complete beginner, working with backend has been challenging, trying to figure out this new environment. But it has been exiting to dive in to things like seeding a database and creating middlewares. I look forward to taking things further and explore connecting backend and frontend.
