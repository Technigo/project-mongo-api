# Mongo API Project
I built an API using MongoDB and Mongoose models. I used Netflix api to find the dataset and built the endpoint with queries for movies and directors.

## The problem
At first I used find() to get all the data to be able to sort it with vanilla JS-methods (like sort and slice) and RegExp to find the endpoints
