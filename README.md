# Project Mongo API

Project about how to use Mongodb to store data, and how to query that data from API. 

## The problem

A basic Netflix API built with Heroku and Express where the data is stored with Mongodb.
I started from last projects with endpoints. I spend some time zooming out and trying to understand how everything belongs.
