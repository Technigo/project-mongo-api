# Project Mongo API

A project including a very rudimentary backend with CRUD-functionality and a connection to MongoDB using Atlas.

## The problem

Describe how you approached to problem, and what tools and techniques you used to solve it. How did you plan? What technologies did you use? If you had more time, what would be next?

I read and watched the available material for this project and dove in. I managed to apply basic CRUD-functionality and then later updated the project with the approach from the lectures.
A possible next step would entail creating a basic frontend and testing it out.

Tech used:
JavaScript, Node.js, Express, MongoDB, env
