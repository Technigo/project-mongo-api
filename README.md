# Project Mongo API

This is a simple API for a list of books.It's made with Node.js, using Express for the web server part and MongoDB for storing all book data.

## The problem

I struggled with the bookID, mostly because I kept trying different ID numbers, and by chance, most of the numbers I tested were not included in the book data. This led me to think something was wrong with the code, especially since this issue occurred with more than one ID I tested.

I added a few more paths where I selected multiple details to be shown. For example, I included pages/ratings with title to a detailes page, and titles were added to language code. A list consisting solely of 'en', 'en-us', or just numbers without context didn't seem very useful.

However, I still struggle with understanding how to use the backend and integrate it with the frontend.
