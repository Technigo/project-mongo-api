# Project Mongo API

The assignment was to create GET routes and endpoints for data in a MongoDB server.

## The problem

Describe how you approached to problem, and what tools and techniques you used to solve it. How did you plan? What technologies did you use? If you had more time, what would be next?

I started with deciding what endpoints to use. I also created a server using MongoDB. If I had more time I would have added more endpoints and removed the case sensitivity.
