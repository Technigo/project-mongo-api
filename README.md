# Mongo API Project

The assigment was to create an API using mongoDB, Express, Atlas and Heroku. I used ‘Netflix titles’ database to store and retrieve data from and use that data to produce a RESTful API.  

Deploying to Heroku was straight forward but setting up the connection to Mongo Atlas was tricky. 

## Requirements
•	API should have two or more endpoints.

•	A minimum of one endpoint to return a collection of results (array of elements).

•	A minimum of one endpoint to return a single result (single element).

•	API should make use of Mongoose models to model the data and use these models to fetch data from the database.

•	API should be RESTful.


## Tech
•	MongoDB
•	Mongoose
•	RESTful API
•	Express
