# Project Mongo API

This week I have been working on building an API using MongoDB. It contains 7 routes, again using my Doctor Who data from last week, but adding some more data to the dataset. Still needed some fun data to work with. 😉
I tried to replicate last week's endpoints using MongoDB.

## The problem

The main problem was actually setting up and connecting all the tools and setting up the database. After that it was pretty straightforward.
