# Project Mongo API

A RESTful API built with Express and MongoDB that provides detailed information about songs. The API offers various endpoints to fetch song data, including filtering by genre, popularity, and BPM (beats per minute).

## The problem

I built this API using Express.js and Mongoose to manage a music database. The main features include:

- Endpoint documentation at the root route
- Song retrieval with pagination (10 songs per page)
- Filtering songs by popularity, genre, and tempo
- Aggregated statistics by genre
- Individual song lookup by ID

Technologies used: Node.js, Express, MongoDB, Mongoose, and Babel for modern JavaScript support.
