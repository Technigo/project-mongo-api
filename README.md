# Mongo API Project

This weeks assignment was all about starting to use a NoSQL database to connect to our backend. For this we used MongoDB.

## The problem

It was a bit tricky to get the MongoDB client up and running. First installed it locally, hooked it up to the express server with the help of Mongoose, and then finally deployed to Heroku.

Really int

Also this is the first time we started using async/await as an alternative method to the fetch API for writing asynchronous code.
