## Features

- Routes using Mongoose methods
- Endpoint for multiple and single results

## Production Process

- I started by choosing a database on Kaggle to create the API. After analysing the response, I planned and structured possible endpoints and their structure.

- I created routes for the collections, like year and genre. Then, used a filter to provide collections for the specific streaming services.

- Created a route to display the endpoints.

- Implemented error handling to the routes.
