This project is an API built with Node.js, Express, and MongoDB, designed to manage a collection of books.

The problem
The task was to create a RESTful API that allows users to perform CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) on a collection of books stored in a MongoDB database. The API needed to handle endpoints for retrieving all books, retrieving a single book by ID, adding new books, updating existing books, and deleting books.

Every project should be deployed somewhere. Be sure to include the link to the deployed project so that the viewer can click around and see what it's all about.
