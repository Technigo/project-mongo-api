# Project Mongo API
This is a backend project using Mongo DB. The API is showing top music data.

Routes: 
- /songs (Show all songs)
- /songs/id/:id (Show a song by id)
- /songs/bpm/:bpm (Show all songs with specific BPM) 
- /ratroute (A special route for rats that apparently likes rythms at 120-140 BPM)

## The problem
- What MongoDB is
- How to model data in Mongo using Mongoose
- How to return useful error messages from your API endpoints
- How to fetch items from a Mongo database using Mongoose
- How to seed large amounts of data to a database
