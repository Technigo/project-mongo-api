# Project Mongo API

Hello! Welcome to the Netflix title API. The data is stored in Mongo DB and is being pulled from there.
Here users can use the following endpoints to find relevant titles they want:

**/api/netflixshows/allshows** is the base endpoint. Users can get all the shows that exist in the database.

**/api/netflixshows/titles/:title** will bring users to a specific title they want.

**"/api/netflixshows/country/:country** will bring users to all shows from a specific country.
