# Project Mongo API
### Week 14 Technigo Bootcamp
This is a project to use Express, MongoDB Compass and MongoDB Atlas along with mongoose to return API endpoints. 

## The problem

First it took sometime just to get Mongo, Mongoose, Compass and Atlas up and running. From there I created the server.js according to the instructions in the class videos. I initially started with data downloaded from an outside source but could not make it work with Mongo so switched to datasets provided. If I have more time I will go back and rework the original animal dataset I had downloaded and would make a frontend to show the API endpoints easier. 

/ - Homepage

/songs  - List of all availible songs in the dataset

/songs?genre=(enter genre of interest here)  - returns songs of particular genres

/songs?danceability(enter # of danceability you would like in your song)   - will list all songs with danceablity higher than what the user inputs
