# Project Mongo API

The purpose of this project was to build a RESTful API using Node, Express and MongoDB. The project enabled us to learn:
- How to model data in Mongo using Mongoose
- How to store secret information such as database passwords
- How to return useful error messages from API endpoints
- How to fetch items from a Mongo database using Mongoose

Personal stretch goals that were achieved:
- Implementation of the most common HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) for retrieving from and sending data to a server
- Documentation with OpenAPI and Swagger tooling
