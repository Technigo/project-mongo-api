# Mongo API Project

Project making a Book API 2.0. This time database deployed with MongoDB.

## The problem

Another project where I used books data for an API that used mongoose methods and deployed with mongoDB. Had a lot of trouble in the beginning with this project when I couldn't get the local DB to work with my computer, had to deploy the DB online to be able to work with it.

If I had more time I would've wanted to focus more on the different mongoose methods.

Every project should be deployed somewhere. Be sure to include the link to the deployed project so that the viewer can click around and see what it's all about.
