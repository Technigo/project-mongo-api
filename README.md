# Project Mongo API

This weeks project was to create a backend using MongoDB database to store and retrieve data from, with a RESTful API.

Endpoints created: 

/songs?genre=pop to list all songs in genre pop

/songs?genre=pop&danceability=76 shows songs in gnre pop and with danceability greater than 76

/songs/id/645f77ae555b7244afb95eaf shows a specific justin Bieber song

The problem
I based the code on a code along example and live session from Technigo. If I had more time I would connect the MongoDB database in Atlas with Google Cloud API platform.
I have som problems with my log in at the moment.
