# Mongo API Project
This project was made during week 18 of the Technigo boot camp. 
The project was to use **MongoDB** and **mongoose** to construct, retrieve, seed and query data in a RESTful way. I also used secrets such as database passwords. Apart from this I also used Express.js.

## The problem
I started by setting up my account at Mongo, and connecting it to Heroku and GitHub, making sure that everything was deployed and connected as it should on Heroku and Mongo Cloud. After that I constructed some routes and endpoints to be able to filter and query the data. The data has two queries and 3 routes.

I have used the npm package express-list-endpoints to list the endpoints in the home endpoint. 

I continuously tested my API using Postman and checked out my database using MongoDB Compass.

If I had more time I would have filtered the data more and trying to implement some more mongoose models. I would also have implemented pages with the methods skip & limit.
