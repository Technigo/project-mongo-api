# Mongo API Project

The goal of this project was to create a RESTful API using MongoDB for the database.

## The problem

We chose to work with a dataset that we got from Kaggle. We built several endpoints using Mongoose methods and even aggregation. We also added several error messages depending on where the error occurs.
