# Mongo API Project

Project making a Book API 2.0. This time database deployed with MongoDB.

## The problem

Another project where I used books data for an API that used mongoose methods and deployed with mongoDB. Had a lot of trouble in the beginning with this project when I couldn't get the local DB to work with my computer, had to deploy the DB online to be able to work with it.

If I had more time I would've wanted to focus more on the different mongoose methods.
