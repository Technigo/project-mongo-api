# Mongo API Project

An API  made with Node.js using Express framwork and storing the data in a Mongo database. The result is a RESTful API that provides food and desserts 🥑🌸🍦🌟

## Code

I've used:
  * **Node.js**
  * **MongoDB**
  * **Express**
  * **mongoose**
  * **RESTful API**
  

## The problem

Completed the codealong and chose to try and create my own API in a small scale to understand how it works. Made two similar types of lists containing either food or dessert items with an endpoint that uses the id to show details about a specific item. Super fun to actually see your data "behind the scenes" before creating some frontend! Next up would be to sort on query and more items to retrive.

There's a preliminary frontend to look at where I've used this API with React.js: https://github.com/bealun/mongo-api-frontend
