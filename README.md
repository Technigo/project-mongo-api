# Project Mongo API

Week 18th proyect. Build an API with Mongo DataBase.
This week's goal was very broad: 
✓ How to create an API using Mongo DB. 
✓ How to model data in Mongo using Mongoose
✓ How to store secret information such as database passwords
✓ How to return useful error messages from your API endpoints
✓ How to fetch items from a Mongo database using Mongoose
✓ How to seed large amounts of data to a database 

All of the key objectives have been challenging, especially with large amounts of data like in this case, but I have learned a lot doing it. I decided to keep on Netflix films to see the differences between one API and the other.

## The problem

The most challenging issues that I had were the seeding of data and the error messages (as clear as possible). I am half way from adding styling but I don not have enough time to render it on time to meet the schedule. I'll do it just for fun. I really love API's and Data Bases!
