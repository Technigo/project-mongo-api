# Project Mongo API

This project implements an API service using the database hosted on MongoDB Atlas and utilises mongoose package to interact with the database.

## The problem

- Installed MongoDB compass, mongoose package and MongoDB to equip the project with the complete setup.
- Used mongoose/MongoDB methods to sort, filter and limit the results.
- Managed to use the aggregation pipeline in MongoDB which executes complex data manipulation.
