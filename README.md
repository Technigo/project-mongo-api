# Mongo API Project

For this week I've created a RESTful API using Express and MongoDB. 

## The problem

I couldn't advance too much in this project. I only got blue requirements following the same structure that we used the last week.

I hope that for the next week I can learn more about Mongo and the best way to do it. 

The API has the following endpoints:

/showId ---- To filter a specific ID
/title/ShowTitle ----- to search by titles
/type/type ---- to filter by type (movies - Tv Show)

## View it live
