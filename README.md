# Mongo API Project

I use MongoDB to store and retrieve data from and use that data to produce a RESTful API.

I have created several routes and endpoints.

## The problem

Mostly just played around and tested diffrent ways.

I have used Mongoose to fetch data from Mongo. And worked in postman.

## View it live

Every project should be deployed somewhere. Be sure to include the link to the deployed project so that the viewer can click around and see what it's all about.
