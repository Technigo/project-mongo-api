# Mongo API Project

In this project I have built and API using MongoDB and Mongoose models. The API has RESTful endpoints and returns arrays of data and a single character. 

I have used Kaggle to find a dataset.

## Learning objectives
- Model data in Mongoose
- Fetch items from a Mongo database using Mongoose
- Seed large amounts of data to a database
