# Mongo API Project

For this project I made a data set of my own inspired by Stackoverflow. It includes questions, how many likes the question has and when it was created. By using the endpoints it is possible to look up certain questions by id, by query parameter you can search for a question including a specific word and also look up the three most popular and the ones that have no likes at all. 

## The problem

To take it even further I would like to add users and answers to the dataset.  

## View it live
