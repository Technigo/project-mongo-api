# Project Mongo API

Create my own database with Mongo DB. 


## The problem

This project was built on last week's assignment. So, I started by copying code from the previous project to use as a boilerplate. This one was quite challenging. For ages, I struggled with importing data from JSON to MongoDB. I ended up installing an older version of MongoDB - and it worked.
