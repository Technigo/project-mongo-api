# Project Mongo API

We were supposed to create an API using Mongoos. Then we should connnect to MongoDB and also deploy it, I did not manage to go anything of that, 

## The problem

I thought it all sounded logical and that there should be no problem, but nothing worked. I tried to create several endpoints but I did not manage to get it to work.

## View it live

Every project should be deployed somewhere. Be sure to include the link to the deployed project so that the viewer can click around and see what it's all about.
