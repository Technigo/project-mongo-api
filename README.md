# Project Mongo API
This project was designed to develop a RESTful API for avocado sales data, utilizing Express.js and MongoDB to manage the database and implement API endpoints effectively.

## The problem

The main challenge was to create efficient queries to retrieve and manipulate data according to the API's requirements. If I had more time, I would implement additional features like authentication and more complex data aggregation to enhance the API's functionality.
