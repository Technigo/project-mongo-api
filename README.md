# Mongo API Project 18


Mission was to use a database to store and retrieve data from and use that data to produce a RESTful API.
Also to model the database using Mongoose models, and persist the data in the database.

- Error handling using Try/Catch.
- Using environment variables.
- Using async/await.
- Seeding a database locally and externally.
- Deployed to Heroku and MongoDB cloud.

Using VS Code, MongoDB Compass, Postman and Chrome.

#### Tech used: 
- Node.js, Express, MongoDB, MongoDB Atlas and JavaScript ES6
- VS Code, MongoDB Compass, Postman and Chrome.

## The problem

I started off by implementing a mongoose model for my database. I then did a local seed to MongoDB and started working on the endpoints. I needed to do some changes in the model and did a new database seed. Kept on working on the endpoints and handling errors. 
When everything worked locally I first deployed to Heroku. Also set up MongoDB Atlas. Tested first with a empty database and then did a seed to MongoDB Atlas using Heroku Config Vars and "RESET_DATABASE=true" to run my seed to db.
