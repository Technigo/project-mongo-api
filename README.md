# Project Mongo API

This week I have been working on building an API using MongoDB. It contains 7 routes, again using my Doctor Who data from last week, but adding some more data to the dataset. I still needed some fun data to work with, and with the new series starting tomorrow, this seemed like the right choice.ðŸ˜‰
I replicated last week's endpoints using MongoDB.

## The problem

The main problem was actually setting up and connecting all the tools and setting up the database. After that it was pretty straightforward.
