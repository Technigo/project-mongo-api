# Mongo API Project

This project is an API project using a MongoDb database to seed and retrieve the data from and to use that data to produce RESTful API. As a data I used book data that contains 500 book reviews. The data is modelled and fetched by using framework Mongoose.

## The problem

I had problems adding sort, skip and limit in my code. I would get a lot of errors for example UnhandledPromiseRejectionWarning: MongoError: the limit must be positive. So I didn't find a solution to work this out.
