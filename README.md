# Yoga API Project :woman-in-lotus-position:

A yogapose database with 43 different yogaposes and the 7 chakras in our body. I yoga theory each yogapose is connected to a different chakra or energyfield in the body, that makes the different poses helpful not only for physical exersice but also for mental wellbeing. For example yogaposes that is affecting the sakral chakra helps us with creativity, the poses connected to the solar plexus chakra affect our self confidence and so on. 

In this database there is endpoints to search and fetch the poses by chakra, name, sanskrit-name and if it should be repeated (if there is a pose that should be done both on the right and left side. Each pose also have an image that is stored from clodinary, and the database also makes it possible to store a user.

## The project

The database is built in MongoDB using Mongoose model where I connected the poses to the chakras, and added the users. I used cloudinary to store all the images, bcrypt and crypto to encrypt the passwords and postman to to check that everything worked.
