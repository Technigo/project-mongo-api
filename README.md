# Project Mongo API

This project involved creating a RESTful API for a book database using Express.js and MongoDB. The API supports operations such as fetching all books, adding a new book, fetching a specific book by its ID, updating a specific book by its ID, and deleting a specific book by its ID.

## The problem

 The challenge was to set up a MongoDB database correctly and defining a Mongoose model for the books, authenitcate correctly and preventing the app from crashing. 
 
 Express.js was used to create the API endpoints. Quite some work was put in handling different types of requests and responses, such as fetching a specific book by its ID and handling errors. Postman was used extensively for testing the API endpoints.
