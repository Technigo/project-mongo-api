# Mongo API Project 🍃

The purpose for this project was to start learning about MongoDB, using a database to store and retrieve data from and use that data to produce a RESTful API.

## Solving the project 💡

I used the books data from the previous project to create the model Book for my data. I used the mongoose method findOne() to be able to find one book based on its id. Other routes/endpoints are the root / and /books endpoint to se all  the books in the data. I also added error-handling in all get-requests.
