# Mongo API Project

This was the first time that I created a database with MongoDb and the tools that came with it.
I used data about the Golden Globes nominations and my goal was to create endpoints to retrieve data on nominees from a certain category and/or year etc.

## The problem

I used MongoDb and Mongoose to create the database model and used Postman to check the paths I created. I stored the database in MongoDb Cloud Atlas and used Heruko to deploy.
