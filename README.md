# Mongo API Project

This project was made during Technigo frontend boot camp. 
The objective was to level up the APIs and start using a database to store and retrieve data from and use that data to produce a RESTful API.

## The problem

The challenge this time was getting all the tools to work and collaborate. Along with MongoDB and Mongoose, there were alot of installations to be done. Keeping track of Mongo Compass, Atlas and the code itself was for me quite a struggle, but also valuable knowledge.
I didn't manage to get the data into the database so need to figure out whats wrong.

## View it live

The data is not stored in the database. It worked locally but not deployed:

// Get all songs:

// Get all feelgood songs: 
https://project-mongo-api-deployment.herokuapp.com/songs?feelgood=true

// Get one song via song id:
https://project-mongo-api-deployment.herokuapp.com/songs/4

// Get one artist: 
https://project-mongo-api-deployment.herokuapp.com/artist/Drake

// Get one genre:
