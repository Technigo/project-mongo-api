# Project Mongo API

A backend project using mongosDB & mongooes

## The problem

Instead of using the provided database, I tried to generate my own database with chatGPT which is something related to my current work (clothing).
I created a few end points base on what I think an e-commerce website would do.

- All items
- Use query to filter items by size
- Filter promotion items
- Best selling items (sort by the quantity was sold)
- Add item
- Delete item

Some of the endpoints I did need to look up of how to do it with mongooes operator, it was a good learning progress.
The biggest problem that I encounter was deploying the data base and connect everything together.
I think it will go smoother when we have more practice in the future.
The testing part, instead of testing on the browser, I tried to utilize tools such as postman and compass more.
I also have problem breaking down the server.js file. As you can see I created the file for the routes, but it didn't work as I expected so I put it back to the server file and will fix it in the future.
