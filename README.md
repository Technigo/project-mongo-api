# Project Mongo API

Using MongoDb to store data in a database and Node to access it via endpoints.

GET artistName route: "/songs/song/:artistName"
GET genre route: "/songs/:genre"

## The problem

Tried out MongoDB in localhost before migrating data to MongoDb Atlas. Improvements could be to structure the code and divide it into folders, as well as removing the RESET_DB env which is written for educational purpose only.
