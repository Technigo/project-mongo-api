# Project Mongo API

In this project I used MongoDB to store and retrieve data and used that data to produce a RESTful API.

## The problem

I used the same dataset that I used in my previous project, project express-api, which is having data about Spotifys top tracks. I used Mongoose models to model and store the data into the database and then used Mongoose Queries to return the data according to the endpoints that I created.
I was able to find the data that I wanted to for this project, but with more time it would be interesting to dig deeper into the MongoDB documentation and explore more about the possible methods to handle data.
