# Project Mongo API

In this project I have used a database to store and retrieve data from, and used that data to produce a RESTful API. I have modeled data in MongoDB using Mongoose.

## The problem

I learned to use the  mongoose model to build endpoints and to fetch data from the database. I also learned how to seed large amount of data into the database.
