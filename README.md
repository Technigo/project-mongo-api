# Mongo API Project

This project follows on from my project express-api where I used a set of data locally. This time I model my database using Mongoose models, and persist the data in the database.

## View it live


## The problem

I have fulfilled the following requriements: 

- The API should have 2 routes. 
- One endpoint to return a **collection** of results (array of elements)
- One endpoint to return a **single** result (single element).
- The API should make use of Mongoose models to model the data and use these models to fetch data from the database.
- The API should be [RESTful](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2018/01/understanding-using-rest-api/)

## Learnings

During this project I have learnt:

- How to model data in Mongoose
- How to fetch items from a Mongo database using Mongoose
- How to seed large amounts of data to a database
