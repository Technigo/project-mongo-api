# Mongo API Project

This project was made during Technigo frontend boot camp. 
The objective was to level up the APIs and start using a database to store and retrieve data from and use that data to produce a RESTful API.

## The problem

The challenge this time was getting all the tools to work and collaborate. Along with MongoDB and Mongoose, there were alot of installations to be done. Keeping track of Mongo Compass, Atlas, Postman and the code itself was for me quite a struggle, but also valuable knowledge!
