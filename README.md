# Project Mongo API

Endpoints:

/songs/all - get all songs

/songs/ - get all songs divided into 20 per page

/songs/:id - delete the ":id" and replace it with number 1-50 to find song by it's id

then I tried to make one for randomly choosing a song - but I can't get it to work...
/songs/random
If you see the issue here - please let me know :D

## The problem

Mostly issues with deploying, the endpoints worked but I had issues with connecting and deploying.
This week I focused on the API itself and therefor did no frontend for this.
