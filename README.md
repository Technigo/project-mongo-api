# Mongo API Project

This project was about creating an API with RESTful endpoints using MongoDB as database to store and retrieve data.

## The problem
The purpose with this project was to learn about how to model data in Mongoose, how the fetch items from a Mongo database using Mongoose and how to seed large amounts of data to a database.

The data I used was from a raw data file with top-music from which I created two models, one for Tracks and one for Artist and routed different endpoints from. I also added middlewares to handle connection errors.
