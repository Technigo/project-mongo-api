# Project Mongo API

This weeks project was to create a backend using MongoDB database to store and retrieve data from, with a RESTful API.

Endpoints created:
/titles: See all Netflix titles in the database
/directors: See all Netflix directors in the database 
/titles/id/_id: Shows a single title based on its id
/directors/id_id: Shows a single director based on its id

## The problem
I based the code on a code along example and live session from Technigo but modified it with other data. If I had more time I would connect the MongoDB database in Atlas with Google Cloud API platform. 

## View it live

Google CLoud API platform: 
(not deployed yet).
