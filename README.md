# Project Mongo API

Model a database using Mongoose models, seed the data and create endpoints using mongoose queries.

## The problem

I used the given JSON-file with topmusic and created endpoints sorting specific artists, songs, genres and danceability. Used JSON.parse and where() to transform the result and filter, which was new to me.
