# Project Mongo API

This weeks project was to create an API with MongoDB and Mongoose. 

## The problem

First I wantched the material, then I created a json.file with cheeses. After that i decided on endpoints and created them. I used the official documentation from Mongoose to find info about methods specific for Mongoose. Then I created the endpoints I wanted.
After that I spent alot of time trying to figure out how to deploy. I got my connection string from MongoDB Atlas, but had a hard time figuring out how to use it and where to use it. ChatGPT couldn't help me either. Finally I got help from a teammate and could deploy.

I have more time, but this week I am focusing on family time and handing in early. If I pick this up later, I will make a frontend for it.
