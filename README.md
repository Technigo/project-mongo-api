# Project Mongo API

The assignmentt was to use Mongo DB to create a database that allows us to store and retrieve data. That data should then be used to create a RESTful API.

## The problem

I looked at last week's project and this weeks videos and code sessions. I then adapted what I'd learned for this weeks assignment. Feedback from last weeks project proved very useful for documenting endpoints.

## View it live

Every project should be deployed somewhere. Be sure to include the link to the deployed project so that the viewer can click around and see what it's all about.
