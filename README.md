# Project Mongo API
This week our project was to produce a RESTful API retrieving data from MongoDB. The methods and tools used in this project include MongoDB Atlas and Mongoose.

## The problem
First, I installed all the tools needed for this assigment. It was a bit hard to get the hang of it in the beginning but after som research and watching the weekly material I made it work. When Mongo worked and I had all the dependencies installed I gradually fetched data for the different routes. If I had more time I would move on to the stretch goals and create more endpoints for my API.
