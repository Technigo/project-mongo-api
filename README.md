# Mongo API Project

This week we started with MongoDB and mongoose to learn how to build and seed a database and not having a hugh data.json file in our project. It was a bit of a challenge to get all the new programs to work but the assignment it self was really fun.

I did not really get the chance to get my error messages to show the way I wanted. I succeeded in some cases but not all. So had I had mote time I would have sorted that out.
