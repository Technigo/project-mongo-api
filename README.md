# Project Mongo API

This project is my first project with database, creating API with database.
I tried my best to handle routing and errors better than my first backend project, so I divided into some folders. ( models, routes, controllers, utils) I also tried to divide my code as much as possible, so that in the future, when I work with bigger backend setup, I know how!!

## The problem

I was really confused with working MongoDB and database as I am really new to backend and never worked with database. So to complete this project, I took some extra courses and read documantation.

The probelm and what I am still not comfortable working with is database. How to connect them, what is SQL and noSQL, (relational database/non-relational database), what I should be carefull when I work with database, and which database to choose. ( firebase/vercel/supabase/mongoDB...)
I have so many things that I need to figfure it out, yet I found it very interesting to work with servers and data.
