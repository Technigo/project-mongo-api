# Project Mongo API

This weeks project is about how to use Mongodb to store data, and how to query that data from your API.

## The problem

In this weeks project it was time to level-up your APIs and start using a database to store and retrieve data from and use that data to produce a RESTful API.That meant to start to understand how mongoDB worked and connect last weeks project and knowledge with this weeks knowledge.
