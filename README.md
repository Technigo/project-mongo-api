# Project Mongo API

This week's project was to start using a database with MongoDB to store data and retrieve data from it, and use that data to produce a RESTful API.

## The problem

I used the spotify dataset as api and used MongoDB and mongoose model. I filterd the properties with number and string values.

My biggest problem was to deploy this week, but solved it together with my team.
