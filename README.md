# Project Mongo API

This week I have built a small backend API. The requirements was to built an API that had at least 2 routes. Minimum of one endpoint should return an array of elements and minimun of one endpoint should return a single element. The API should be built as Mongoose models and it should be RESTful.

## The problem

If I had more time I would definately build a small front-end to display the data in a nice way. I would also look into why the 404-messages doesn't seem to work as expected.
