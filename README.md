# Project Mongo API

This week I looked at how to use MongoDB to store data, and how to query that data from your API. I did 2 routes one from local json, and then I  retrieved data from Kaggle and convert it to JSON file. I also learnt some methods such as;
 find()
 findOne()
 findById()
 limit()
 sort()
 select()

## The problem

The problem was to connect everything through MongoDB and google cloud,
and "personal problem" was to get the node to work 
 - The solution was to to downgrade node from v18 to v16.
