## The problem

I don't quite have my head around this

Tried to return a singel netflixtitle id => was overrinding my other code 

I managed to return (A list of directors) but was override by the ID funcation 

Asked my team for help (but could not find the right way to ask about this isssue)

Need to improve the returning of objects

Otherwise it was a challangeing and quite fun project (good to learn these thinks and want to learn more)
