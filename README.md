# Mongo API Project

This was a project I did while attending the Technigo frontend bootcamp. The task was to start using a database to store and retrieve data from and use that data to produce a RESTful API.

## The problem

I had the most problems creating error messages that would be sent to the user if the reguested data doesnÂ´t excist. But with a little help from my team I solved it.
