# Project Mongo API

This is an API for a list of books. 
It's made with Node.js, using Express for the web server part and MongoDB for storing all book data.

## The problem

Two of us cooperated on this project. Connecting to the database worked well. 
We added a few more paths where we selected multiple details to be shown. For example, pages/ratings with title to a detailes page, and titles were added to language code. A list consisting solely of 'en', 'en-us', or just numbers without context didn't seem very useful.
