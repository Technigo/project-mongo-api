# Mongo API Project
This project was made during week 18 of the Technigo boot camp. 
The project was to use Mongo DB and mongoose to construct, retrieve, seed and query data using mongoose. We also used secrets such as database passwotds.

## The problem

I started by setting up my account at Mongo, and connecting it to Heroku and GitHub, making sure that everything was deployed and connected as it should on Heroku and Mongo Cloud.
After that I constructed some routes and endpoints to be able to filter and query the data. If I had more time I would have filtered the data even more, using mongoose models and also I would have implemented pages with the methods skip & limit.
