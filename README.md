# Beer style guide API

This week was about using MongoDB to store data, and how to query that data from our API.
I used a dataset from Kaggle, which I tweaked a little. The data is from the Beer Judge Certification Program (BJCP) 2015 guidelines. The beer style guidelines are used in order to categorize beers and judge beer competitions. 

## The endpoints

/beers - all beers in a long list
/beers?style= - All beers in a certain style - example query: /beers?style=Kellerbier
/beers/:id - A certain beer - example query: /beers/6460d8450c3f651774e546c8

## The problem

This week I was sick again. If I had more time, I would definitely work on different aggregations, filters and more paths. I've done a very tentative frontend as well.
