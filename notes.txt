Danceability
Danceability describes how suitable a track is for dancing based on a combination 
of musical elements including tempo, rhythm stability, beat strength, and overall 
regularity. A value of 0.0 is least danceable and 100 is most danceable.


Valence
A measure from 0.0 to 100 describing the musical positiveness conveyed by a track. 
Tracks with high valence sound more positive (e.g. happy, cheerful, euphoric), while 
tracks with low valence sound more negative (e.g. sad, depressed, angry).
